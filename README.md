Chatbot Application:
You are a career advisor working for a university that offers many degrees, including a degree in computer science. You know that there is a vast range of computing jobs and that students who are about to graduate are generally aware of their disciplinary preferences and personal strengths. The enrollment of computer science students at your university has been increasing and you can no longer meet with each of them individually to give career guidance. During a meeting of career advisors, your manager suggests that you develop a chatbot that may reduce your workload and interact with students to help them identify jobs in computing fields for which they are qualified.

You have been asked to identify five job types that require an undergraduate degree in computer science and to construct a chatbot in the Pandorabot environment. The chatbot will interact with individual students, help them identify their strengths and preferences, and help them decide which career options to consider.

Disaster Relief Robot:

Real-time search-and-rescue robots are increasingly used to supplement the efforts of the first responders in areas affected by natural disasters. They are used to spot-check the situational awareness of people in distress, survey the extent of flood or tornado damage, evaluate the number of people that had not been evacuated from their neighborhoods, clean debris, and create passable routes.

For this task, you will use the Coppelia Robotics virtual robot and its environment to demonstrate how such robots may be used in disaster recovery. Your first step is to familiarize yourself with this technology by reviewing the information in the “Coppelia Robotics Resources Page” and “CoppeliaSim User Manual” provided in the Web Links section.

For the next step, you will thoroughly describe a disaster situation similar to the ones mentioned above. Next, you will create a virtual prototype of an autonomous robotic recovery system that demonstrates goal-seeking behaviors in navigating through a predefined area. The robotic recovery system will solve a disaster recovery problem of your choice by using the Coppelia Robotics BubbleRob and its environment as the starting point of your prototyping. You will also add sensors to the robot. These sensors will collect vital information to aid in the disaster recovery effort for the scenario you described.
